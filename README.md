## Idea

Every individual aim to have a stable and secure solution to their network
vulnerabilities. Despite extensive study into Intrusion Detection Systems and a
a plethora of antivirus software, there are currently no effective solutions until all of
the parameters of an intrusion detection system are met, which are time-consuming,
cumbersome, and require constant updating. This project discusses the challenges
that IDS developers confront in establishing an effective intrusion detection
the system, as well as its limitations and difficulties related to the development and
organization of intrusion detection systems.

We have trained & tested various machine-learning algorithms on the infamous <a href="https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html">NSL-KDD dataset.</a> This was achieved by carefully analyzing the data, pre-processing it, and training on it to gain satisfactory performance on the test set.


#### How to Run:


1. Git Clone the repository and cd into you the directory and type:
```sh
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the following command to run on a local server:
```sh
    $ python app.py
```
 
3. Go to ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` on the browser to use the app.
